	part_254_S01_P02.mp3	Mhm. I think it's good to keep like, a little bit of the
	part_255_S01_P02.mp3	The sauce?
	part_256_S01_P02.mp3	 almost done 
	part_257_S01_P02.mp3	Oh, it says you have to add two thirds, a hundred fifty milliliters of water.
	part_258_S01_P02.mp3	With the seasoning mix.
	part_259_S01_P02.mp3	Oh okay. Is there a measuring cup?
	part_260_S01_P02.mp3	Um

	part_265_S01_P02.mp3	That looks like a cup and a half, no?
	part_266_S01_P02.mp3	A ro- rough estimate.
	part_267_S01_P02.mp3	 Yeah.
	part_268_S01_P02.mp3	Let me see if there's a measuring cup.

	part_270_S01_P02.mp3	Oh sorry. Oh, that's true.
	part_271_S01_P02.mp3	Hundred fifty.
	part_272_S01_P02.mp3	Oh, there's like a science beaker thing up top there. I don't know what that is.

	part_280_S01_P02.mp3	It'll be fine, just
	part_281_S01_P02.mp3	Just estimate it .
	part_282_S01_P02.mp3	Yeah just, yeah. Okay then less than a full cup I guess.
	part_283_S01_P02.mp3	Okay. Is there a glass? 
	part_284_S01_P02.mp3	Yeah. There's a glass right here.
	part_285_S01_P02.mp3	And then it says, oh, sorry, it says to make it simmer or something.
	part_286_S01_P02.mp3	No it's okay.
	part_287_S01_P02.mp3

	part_10_S01_P03.mp3	After the beef?

	part_10_S01_U01.CH3.mp3	After the beef?

	part_279_S01_U01.CH3.mp3	Yeah.
	part_280_S01_U01.CH3.mp3	It'll be fine, just
	part_281_S01_U01.CH3.mp3	Just estimate it .

	part_7_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	Okay.
	part_8_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	We could probably put these on the pan, too, if we wanted to warm them up a bit.
	part_9_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	Yeah. Maybe we can do that after?
	part_10_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	After the beef?

	part_265_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	That looks like a cup and a half, no?
	part_266_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	A ro- rough estimate.
	part_267_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	 Yeah.

	part_280_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	It'll be fine, just
	part_281_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	Just estimate it .
	part_282_S01_U01.CH4.mp3	Yeah just, yeah. Okay then less than a full cup I guess.

	part_10_S01_U02.CH1.mp3	After the beef?

	part_9_S01_U03.CH1.mp3	Yeah. Maybe we can do that after?
	part_10_S01_U03.CH1.mp3	After the beef?
	part_11_S01_U03.CH1.mp3	So maybe someone can help cook or cut tomatoes or something? Or like dice them? I don't know who's good at dicing and, uh.

	part_9_S01_U04.CH2.mp3	Yeah. Maybe we can do that after?
	part_10_S01_U04.CH2.mp3	After the beef?
	part_11_S01_U04.CH2.mp3	So maybe someone can help cook or cut tomatoes or something? Or like dice them? I don't know who's good at dicing and, uh.

	part_10_S01_U05.CH2.mp3	After the beef?

	part_9_S01_U05.CH3.mp3	Yeah. Maybe we can do that after?
	part_10_S01_U05.CH3.mp3	After the beef?
	part_11_S01_U05.CH3.mp3	So maybe someone can help cook or cut tomatoes or something? Or like dice them? I don't know who's good at dicing and, uh.

	part_9_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah. Maybe we can do that after?
	part_10_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	After the beef?
	part_11_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	So maybe someone can help cook or cut tomatoes or something? Or like dice them? I don't know who's good at dicing and, uh.

	part_265_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	That looks like a cup and a half, no?
	part_266_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	A ro- rough estimate.
	part_267_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	 Yeah.
	part_268_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Let me see if there's a measuring cup.
	part_269_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Isn't one cup normally two hundred and fifty milliliters?
	part_270_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Oh sorry. Oh, that's true.
	part_271_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Hundred fifty.
	part_272_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Oh, there's like a science beaker thing up top there. I don't know what that is.
	part_273_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Speaker?
	part_274_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Like a beaker? 
	part_275_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Oh beaker.
	part_276_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	
	part_277_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Do they have a measuring cup? 
	part_278_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	If not I would just eyeball it or something.
	part_279_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah.
	part_280_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	It'll be fine, just
	part_281_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Just estimate it .
	part_282_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah just, yeah. Okay then less than a full cup I guess.
	part_283_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Okay. Is there a glass? 
	part_284_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah. There's a glass right here.
	part_285_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	And then it says, oh, sorry, it says to make it simmer or something.
	part_286_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	No it's okay.
	part_287_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	
	part_288_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Okay, so let me add this.
	part_289_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Wait, which one is this?
	part_290_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	So which one is this and which is seasoning mix?
	part_291_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Oh okay. This is sauce.
	part_292_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Wait, where's that. Oh. Here, wait.
	part_293_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Good thing I'm looking at this.
	part_294_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	So you said two thirds?
	part_295_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	
	part_296_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Two thirds, two thirds of a cup.
	part_297_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	That's like two thirds.
	part_298_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	With the seasoning mix.
	part_299_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah.
	part_300_S01_U06.CH4.mp3	Yeah. So wait until it's completely cooked, yeah it's brown.
